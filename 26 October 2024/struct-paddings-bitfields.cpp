// int x: Takes 4 bytes, now starting at a 4-byte aligned boundary.
// char y: Takes 1 byte. To align the next member (double d) on an 8-byte boundary, the compiler adds 7 bytes of padding after y.
// double d: Takes 8 bytes, starting on an 8-byte aligned boundary.

// Bitfields a, b, c, and d:

// Bitfields in C++ are stored within the smallest multiple of their base type, which is unsigned int (4 bytes or 32 bits) here.
// The total number of bits in the bitfields is 3 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 14 bits, which the compiler packs into a 4-byte unsigned int.
// int x:

// The int x member takes 4 bytes (32 bits), and with #pragma pack(1), it will directly follow the packed bitfields without extra padding.
// Size Calculation:

// 4 bytes for the unsigned int that holds the bitfields (a, b, c, and d).
// 4 bytes for int x.
// Thus, even with #pragma pack(1), the structure size is 8 bytes if the compiler
//  fully optimizes for #pragma pack(1). However, due to some compilers' internal alignment
// rules for specific architectures, the structure may still round to 12 bytes to optimize 
// access or meet alignment constraints for more efficient memory access.

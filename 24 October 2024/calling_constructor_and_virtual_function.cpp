// Base Constructor
// Base show
// Derived Constructor



// The Base constructor runs first.
// When show() is called within Base's constructor, it does not invoke Derived::show()
// but rather Base::show() because the Derived part of the object hasnâ€™t been fully constructed.
// After Base's constructor completes, the Derived constructor runs, and at this point, the vtable
//  for Derived is fully established.
